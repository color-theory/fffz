# fffz
chrome extension for ffz without the cruft

This is an _extremely_ lightweight text replacement extension for use with twitch.tv. It is meant to be an alternative for people who would
rather not install proprietary extensions with risky permissions. 

## How to use
This assumes that you know how to install local extensions onto your chrome browser, but here are the basics.

* In `main.js` replace the array with your own. You will need to figure out how to do the appropriate scraping, but feel free to reach out to me if you get stuck.
* go to `chrome://extensions` in your url bar.
* click `Load unpacked`
* choose the folder for this project and select it.

Go to twitch and type in chat. You should now see the appropriate emotes replaced with fun images :)
